# Coursera Public Coursework | James Arlow

### Overview

[Coursera](http://www.coursera.org "Coursera") is a MOOC platform offering curated courses by professors and staff from notable academic institutions.

This is a public portfolio of work I've done for the course, specifically regarding courses targeting [Data Science].  

### Concerning Academic Honesty

Because of academic honesty requirements, coursework is assumed to be confidential by default.  While this offends my open source sensibilities, the structure of the assignments would tend to enable plagiarism if I were to share my entire collection of coursework.  For this reason, only assignments that were published as part of the grading process are included.

Private access to my other coursework, including [Data Science] quizzes and automatically graded [Scala] projects, is available upon request.  Interested parties must be willing to state the nature of their interest and that they will not use their access to enable academic dishonesty.

### What's included



### Original publishing details

Originally the projects were published in their own repositories, as per assignment instructions.  Now that grading has been long resolved, they have been condensed here, to preserve them, provide more coherent overview for visitors, and clean up my github account.
